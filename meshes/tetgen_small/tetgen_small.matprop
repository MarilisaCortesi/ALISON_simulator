# CHECK THE MEASUREMENT UNITS the sw makes some automatic conversions
# mass density of the structure
rho [ug/mm3]-> 1000
# heat capacity  i.e. amount of energy needed to change the temperature by one point. The reasoning behind this value is in notebook 2
cv [J*l/ug]-> 0.00001
# thermal conductivity. Average of measured value in collagen gel. See notebook 2. I have reduced it by 4 orders of magnitude. Too high otherwise
k [mm2/s]-> 1.65e-4
