# This file contains the configuration parameters for the organotypic model initially described in Peters et al 2015
#(doi: 10.3791/53541). It is composed of 3 layers initially containing fibroblasts (the bottom one), mesothelial cells (middle)
# and cancer cells (the top). The amount of fibroblasts and mesothelial cells is fixed while the number of cancer cells
# can be adjusted (in the main configuration file).

mesh:
name -> tetgen_80K_elements

cells:
fibroblasts -> fibroblast_cells_config.txt, 4000, healthy, bottom layer
mesothelial -> mesothelial_cells_config.txt, 20000, healthy, middle layer

layers:
bottom layer -> 0,50
middle layer -> 50,75
top layer -> 75, 100

boundary conditions:
fixed value -> top
fixed flux -> bottom, side

material parameters:
# mass density of the structure [g/mm3]
rho -> 0.001
# heat capacity i.e. amount of energy needed to change the temperature by one point. The reasoning behind this value is in notebook 2
cv -> 1
# thermal conductivity. Average of measured value in collagen gel. See notebook 2
k -> 1.65e-6
# amount of waste products produced by each cell
p -> 0
# imposed flux
q_bar -> 0
